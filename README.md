For this project Lina Gamerman and Charlie Phillips will be working together. Since we both turned 21 we thought it would be a fun idea to create a page dedicated to Lina and Charlie’s bar! The navigational interface will be a menu. When you can click on drinks the menu, it will link to another web page that has the drink specified. We are thinking of using SVG’s to create the images of the drinks. The three drinks we are thinking of animating and creating are wine, beer and a martini. Each drink will have an empty glass next to it, and then some user interaction will pour the drink into the glass. Additionally, each page will have a theme, associated with a certain country of the drink’s origin. For example, the beer type would be Paulaner, a beer from Munich, Germany. On this page, we will add Bavarian music to the scene and the background will be at the Oktoberfest in Munich where the beer is served. The Martini page will represent a Manhattan, and then the wine will be from Spain. Each drink page will have appropriate music and video from its origin and decorations to transport you to this country!
